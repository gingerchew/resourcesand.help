## Why?

In October of 2022, Twitch streamer Amouranth revealed that she was in an abusive relationship with her husband. This led to a lot of discussion, some of it much needed. The topic that lead the discourse was about *how* we talk about abuse in chat. 

The inspiration for this site came from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/bbjessTTV/status/1581745451207782401), calling on content creators, streamers in particular, to include a chat command that lists resources for hotlines and charities.

With this site, the hope is to provide a place for streamers and other content creaters to send viewers to, where information is consolidated and verified.
