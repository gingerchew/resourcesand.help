# Why?

In October of 2022, Twitch streamer Amouranth revealed that she was in an abusive relationship with her husband. This led to a lot of discussion, some of it much needed. The topic that lead the discourse was about *how* we talk about abuse in chat. 

The inspiration for this site came from [this tweet](https://twitter.com/bbjessTTV/status/1581745451207782401), calling on content creators, streamers in particular, to include a chat command that lists resources for hotlines and charities.

## Is this the best place to find resources?

No, this site is meant to be a reasonable collection of resources. Keeping it close in scope and only keeping resources related to Domestic Abuse, LGBTQ+, and Suicide Prevention. 

## One of the resources listed is out of date

Please let us know! Click the button in the footer, fill out the form, and we'll review it as soon as possible.

## How do I set up a chat command for my channel?

There are a number of bots out there that you can set up with your Twitch channel. 

- [Nightbot](https://nightbot.tv/)
- [Stream Elements](https://streamelements.com/)
- [MixItUp Bot](https://mixitupapp.com/)

An example command would go behind the command `!resources` and have the message:

> When talking about domestic abuse, please be respectful and remember it is triggering for some. If you or a loved one needs help, resources are available at {{ config.domain }}

The language can be changed, for example if you want to avoid the subject or are more open to talking about it.
